two objects exert a force of attraction on one another known as gravity sir isaac newton quantified the gravity between two objects when he formulated his three laws of motion the force tugging between two bodies depends on how massive each one is and how far apart the two lie even as the center of the earth is pulling you toward it keeping you firmly lodged on the ground your center of mass is pulling back at the earth but the more massive body barely feels the tug from you while with your much smaller mass you find yourself firmly rooted thanks to that same force yet newtons laws assume that gravity is aninnate force of an object that can act over a distance albert einstein in his theory of special relativity determined that the laws of physics are the same for all non accelerating observers and he showed that the speed of light within a vacuum is the same no matter the speed at which an observer travels as a result he found that space and time were interwoven in to a single continuum known as space time events that occur at the same time for one observer could occur at different times for another as he worked out the equations for his general theory of relativity einstein realized that massive objects causeda distortion in space time imagine setting a large body in the center of at ram poline the body would press down into the fabric causing it to dimple a marble rolled around the edge would spiral inward toward the body pulled in much the same way that the gravity of a planet pulls at rocks in space
